# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 5, 2026

## 1. Introduction

GitWriter is built with privacy as a core principle. This policy explains how we handle your data.

## 2. Data We Collect

### 2.1 Data We DON'T Collect

GitWriter does **not** collect or store:

- Your Markdown content (stored only in your GitHub repositories)
- Personal information beyond what GitHub provides
- Usage analytics or tracking data
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Any data on our own servers

### 2.2 Data We DO Access

To function, GitWriter needs access to:

- Your GitHub profile information (username, avatar, email)
- Repository listings (to show your repos)
- File contents (to edit Markdown files)
- Commit creation permissions (to save your changes)

This access is granted by you through GitHub's OAuth and is used only to perform the app's core functions.

## 3. How We Protect Your Data

- **No Server Storage**: We don't store your content on our servers
- **GitHub Integration**: Your data stays on GitHub's infrastructure
- **Secure Authentication**: We use GitHub's official OAuth flow
- **No Credentials**: We never see or store your GitHub password
- **No Tracking**: We don't use analytics or tracking services

## 4. GitHub as Data Controller

GitHub is the primary custodian of your data. By using GitWriter, you are also subject to GitHub's Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review GitHub's privacy practices.

## 5. Third-Party Services

GitWriter integrates only with:

- **GitHub**: For repository access and authentication
- **Expo Services**: Only for app build and distribution (no user data access)

## 6. Data Retention

Since we don't store your data, "retention" is handled entirely by GitHub according to their policies and your repository settings. You can delete your content at any time by:

- Deleting files through GitWriter
- Deleting repositories through GitHub
- Deleting your GitHub account

## 7. Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Access all your data (it's in your GitHub repos)
- Delete your data (through GitHub or GitWriter)
- Revoke GitWriter's access (through GitHub Settings → Applications)
- Export your data (by cloning your repositories)

## 8. Children's Privacy

GitWriter is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## 9. International Users

Your data is processed and stored according to GitHub's data processing policies, which may involve international data transfers. Review GitHub's privacy policy for details.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Significant changes will be noted in the app and on this page.

**GitWriter's Privacy Promise**: *Your words belong to you. They live on your GitHub repositories, not on our servers. We simply provide the notebook.*
